If you are new to Strapi. I will suggest you start from [offical strapi documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html)

If you want to start from this project. You should have a local `mongodb` server or `docker` installed. Otherwise you will need to edit the database configuration in `strapi/config/database.ts`.

### Development

For first time to clone the project run

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

then, to start development

```
yarn dev
```

or you like to using docker. just

```bash
docker-compose up
```
